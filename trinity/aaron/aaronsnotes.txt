 One tred, storytelling. Mix with persona.  Have a story about each persona was
 involed with CHF.  After story, move on to information for that persona.

 Who are you?  What do you want to do?  Idea of designing your own adventure.
 Might ask, Who are you?  Are you like John, who volunteers regularly and delivers boxes ...
 have a video, testimony and also menu options that appear with volunteer
 When mouse moves over volunteer, you get option of hearing a testimony and other menu items.

Menu options such as "About Us" and then "About You" and "Donate".
Under "About You",  say  "Friends like YOU make CHF the ministry that it is!  Some of you, like John,
volunteer time to give out food packs.  To hear John's story, click here.  To learn about how you could
volunteer, click here."
"Some of you, like Pastor Bob, have made mercy ministry ..."
"Some of you, like Carol, are corporate sponsors, ....  To learn more, ..."
Have pictures and info as mouse passes over?
This is similar to the Brian Hoff/work page.
