General Thoughts:

-any websites that rely on a scroll for pagination have an arrow to indicate
 the need for scrolling and a way for the user to monitor which page they are
 on.

List of Websites:

http://parallaxis.it/

 --This site uses flat/responsive design elements on a single scrolling
   page. I especially like the team section

Makers Quarter

 --This page does not have the same layout as the screenshot but, the layout
   present in the screen shot would be a good way to organize the top of the page

http://www.drinksmartwater.com/

 --Although the website is a little bit much, the idea of scrolling up was
   what I found interesting.

 --I especially like the work section with the responsive tiles

http://bear.canu.se/

 --Although the content is not G rated, the idea of a story leading you to a
   location is very creative

http://stashflaticons.com/

 --This is so simple and easy to navigate with no scrolling and everything laid
   in front of you.

 --Giving a decision in the being and basing the site off of that decision seems
   to be a great way to tailor content

http://thisistheplace.tv/

 --The way that this leads you to the content page that you want is clean and
   helps filter the user's interest
